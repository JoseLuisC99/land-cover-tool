## General info
This project is the result of our participation in the IA 2022 hackathon, whose objective was to create applications using artificial intelligence algorithms to solve real challenges.

The challenge we chose is the Aerospace Challenge. With the new abilities of satellites, we have more and more information about the geography, topography, climate and temperature of the earth; This is where it becomes vitally important to find solutions that use data from the aerospace sector to create an application.

The intention of our project is to locate specific areas such as urban land, agricultural land, grasslands, forest land, water and barren land with the intention of taking better solutions in urban and agricultural growth.
